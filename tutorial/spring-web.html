<body><h1> Embracing the Web with Spring MVC </h1>

<p> The original code in Spring was written to support the web. Indeed, the earliest classes (like, <span
        module="spring-web" class="class-reference">org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext</span>) that
    Spring founder Rod Johnson wrote in his study in England in 2001 were to support Java-based web applications
    environments. Spring's always had a great support for the web. From the beginning, Spring has featured an MVC
    framework, called Spring MVC. Spring MVC at the time looked conceptually very similar to the then entrenched Struts
    framework. While Spring MVC evolved on its own merits, Spring did everything possible to ease the lives of
    developers using other web frameworks, like Struts. The Spring-Struts integration support in the core Spring web
    modules made Struts a much nicer proposition for developers who were stuck using Struts, but wanted a cleaner,
    POJO-centric component model. Indeed, Springs JSF integration for 1.0 and 2.0, as well as the JSF-centric Spring Web
    Flow, offer drastically improved user experiences for developers stuck on those web frameworks. While Struts is
    largely a distant memory, and JSF is fast-becoming one, Spring MVC has emerged as, and remained, the most popular
    Java web framework in the world. </p>

<P> There are a lot of reasons for this, but I think it's because Spring MVC has <EM>embraced</EM> the web, not
    attempted to hide developers from it. Indeed, if Spring MVC can be said to <EM>hide</EM> anything, it is the
    complexities of building scalable Servlet-based applications, <EM>not</EM> the web. </P>

<P> Conceptually, web programming is simple: HTTP requests come in, and responses are created and sent in response. No
    state is retained in between requests on either the server or the client, by default. This can be deceptively
    simple. As requests come in, they invariably are handled by some component that acts on them, and is then charged
    with sending a response. A response, in the common case, is some sort of HTML-based page. Unfortunately, there's
    often a disconnect between effective handling of requests (and tying those requests to the appropriate back-end
    business logic) and rendering of nice responses. Put another way, programmers are rarely good user-interface
    designers. So, a separation of the two domains - business logic and server-side handling from designing and
    rendering rich interactive user interfaces - is often necessary. This way, programmers can work on the part that
    matters most to them - the business logic - and the Adobe Dreamweaver-toting designers can focus on the styling and
    design of the user interface. To keep programming applications that behave in this way simpler, programmers have
    adopted a variant of the popular <span class="wikipedia">MVC</span> pattern called <span id="model2mvc"
                                                                                             class="wikipedia">Model-2 MVC</span>.
    This pattern is best visually described like this: </P>

<div class="diagram"><img src="images/model 2 mvc.png"/> <span class="caption"> The Model-2 MVC pattern </span></div>
<P> As HTTP requests come in, they're routed to the <EM>front controller</EM> - the <span module="spring-web"
                                                                                          class="class-reference">org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</span>
    in Spring MVC - which then selects from among the registered <EM>controller</EM> classes and chooses the right one
    to handle the HTTP request. There needs to be some stipulation between the <EM>front controller</EM> and the
    registered controllers as to which controller should handle which request. When the controller is activated, it is
    given access to all the data about the request and it can react accordingly. Once the request is handled, the
    controller must somehow signal that a response should be rendered. Typically, this means telling the framework which
    <EM>view</EM>, or <EM>response</EM>, to render. A view might be a designer-provided template that merges data into
    itself and then renders as HTML. The response might also be something constructed in code in the controller, like
    file data or the binary data for a PDF or spreadsheet. </P>

<P> Let's build a simple web application to see how the moving parts fit together. Our application will be a simple
    Customer Relationship manager (CRM) of sorts. Users can create an account, login and then manage simple customer
    records. We already have Hibernate-based backend services that manage user (<span module="services"
                                                                                      class="class-reference">org.springsource.examples.spring31.services.UserService</span>)
    and customer (<span module="services" class="class-reference">org.springsource.examples.spring31.services.CustomerService</span>)
    data for us. We're using <A href="http://maven.apache.org">the Apache Maven</A> build tool to include those classes
    in our web application. </P>

<p> Working with Spring MVC is <EM>very</EM> straightforward! If you're using a Servlet 3.0 container like the market
    and segment-leading <A href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Apache Tomcat 7</A>, then it's even easier! Our initial Java
    web application consists of three classes - <span module="web" class="class-reference">org.springsource.examples.spring31.web.config.servlet.CrmWebApplicationInitializer</span>,
    <span module="web" class="class-reference">org.springsource.examples.spring31.web.config.WebMvcConfiguration</span>,
    and <span module="web" class="class-reference">org.springsource.examples.spring31.web.ViewController</span> - and
    several artifacts to generate the HTML views. Let's look at these classes. </p>

<P> To work with any web framework, like Spring MVC, you need to install the various Servlet components using a
    deployment descriptor (<code>web.xml</code>) or, alternatively, in Servlet 3 environments, a Java initializer class.
    This is a Java Servlet 3.0-compatible web application. Servlet 3.0 applications run in any web container that
    supports Servlet 3.0, including Apache Tomcat 7. You can use Spring in containers that support earlier versions of
    the Servlet specification, however some Servlet 3.0-specific capabilities - such as Java-based initializer classes
    and features designed to support asynchronous responses won't work in those environments. We'll mention the Servlet
    3.0 specific bits as we encounter them. </p>

<P> The Servlet environment provides a few low level class types that can be used to help you build many powerful types
    of web applications. They are, however, very low level, and provide very little save for the hooks to build more
    sophisticated infrastructure, which Spring MVC provides. </P>

    <LI><B>Servlets</B> - objects of type <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">javax.servlet.Servlet</code>
        that are given a chance to act on incoming HTTP requests and produce replies. This is the most common type of
        component. <CODE>Servlet</CODE>s are mapped to the URLs that they will respond to by a type of pattern.
    </LI>
    <LI><B>Listener</B> - objects of type <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">java.util.EventListener</CODE>
        - typically of a Servlet-speciifc subclass like <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">javax.servlet.ServletContextListener</CODE>
        or <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener</CODE>. These
        classes are notified of various events in the web application such as the creation of data stored in memory, the
        changes in the Servlet container itself, or changes in one of the Servlets managed by a web application
        container. .
    </LI>
    <LI><B>Filters</B> - objects of type <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">javax.servlet.Filter</CODE>
        that are given a chance to act on, or possibly change, incoming HTTP requests before they are routed to the
        <CODE module="servlets" class="class-reference">javax.servlet.Servlet</CODE>s to which they've been routed and
        all outbound HTTP replies produced by those <CODE>Servlets</CODE>. This is useful in many scenarios - such as
        processing security on all requests, or handling things like GZip compression.

    Changing Face of the Web </h1>

<P> While individual resources, such as CSS and images and JavaScript are served up the web server, and while initial
    HTML pagses are sent down from the server, much of the interaction that happens between the user and the user
    interface happens these days entirely on the client. The server doesn't really need to get involved too much in
    rendering HTML, besides serving the initial page load and the resources to support it. Nowadays, the client can do a
    <EM>lot</EM> of interesting things, and doesn't need to rely on the server to keep user-interface state. Indeed all
    the server has to do is keep <EM>business</EM> state, and make that available to the client.
